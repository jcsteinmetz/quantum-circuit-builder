Quantum Circuit Builder is a GUI for designing and simulating quantum linear optical circuits.

## Key features
* Easy, intuitive way to design new circuits by drawing components on an interactive canvas
* Simulate the state probabilities generated by new circuit diagrams
* Save and load circuit designs
* Benchmark performance metrics for different industry simulators

## List of implemented backends
### Demo simulators (basic implementations written specifically for this project)
* Fock space backend
* Matrix permanent backend
### Industry simulators
* [Strawberry fields](https://github.com/XanaduAI/strawberryfields) Fock backend
* [Perceval](https://github.com/Quandela/Perceval) Naive backend
